Of the samples, 8 had a healthy pregnancy, 4 experienced early onset (preterm) preeclampsia, and 6 experienced late onset (term) preeclampsia. This information was encoded in a class vector (D). Genes with low counts were removed and the datasets were then normalised using the TMM method. Differential Expression Analysis RNA-Seq DE Analysis univariate tools adopt an inferential approach in statistically testing for a set of individual genes that are differentially expressed between conditions. We used the edgeR pipeline [2] to fit a negative binomial distribution for each gene in (A) and (B). Pairwise comparisons between the three groups were then performed with a likelihood ratio test and adjusted for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg method. Significant genes are labelled upregulated if the log fold change is positive and downregulated otherwise. Click here to see the interactive DE results - Warning: Large data will be loaded sPLS-DA PLS-DA [3] decomposes the class vector (D) and each of (A), (B) and (C) into linear combinations of a latent component and a loading vector, using matrix factorisation, such that the covariance between the components is maximised. The number of components to decompose into and the number of variables per component were tuned by treating the output as a classification problem and cross-validating using leave-one-out schema. Its multi-omics variant, DIABLO [3], integrates all (A), (B), (C) and (D) in maximising covariance.
